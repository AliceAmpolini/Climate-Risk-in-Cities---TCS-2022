Urban Flood Resilience
For the correct development of this part of the project it is recommended to read the thesis by Ampolini to have an overview and clear directions on how to quantify each indicator. 
Each case study has 3 folders containing the files needed for the quantificiation of the indicator. More specifically: 
- Kigali focuses on both fluvial and pluvial flooding, while Addis Ababa and Nairobi only focus on pluvial flooding due to non existing damages caused by the rivers. 
- Before starting I would recommend to apply on QGIS the footprint shapefile to establish the boundaries of the case studies. The file can be found in the folders with the indicators.
- The Beyond Design Event analyses pluvial flooding with a return period of 15 years, while the return period of fluvial flooding (in Kigali) is 40 years.
